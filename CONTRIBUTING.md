# Contributing to Intesa SanPaolo Bitcoin Tracker

I love your input! I want to make contributing to Intesa SanPaolo Bitcoin Tracker as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## How to become a contributor?

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Make sure that your PR works locally by running the following commands:

- `npm run format`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run install:all`
- `npm run dev`

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/intesa-tracker/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/alessandromazza98/intesa-tracker/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
